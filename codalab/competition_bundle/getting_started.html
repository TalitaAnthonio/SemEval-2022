<h3> How to get started</h3>

<ul>
    <li> Step 1: Register for the competition </li>
    <!-- Ask if we want to provide the baselines on github page or also on Codalab. On Codalab, people tend to only put the data here. -->
    <li> Step 2: Run the baselines for regression and/or classification. The baselines can be found here (TODO: add). </li>
    <li> Step 3: Submit a csv file with your systems output predictions. The maximum number of submissions is 10.  </li>
