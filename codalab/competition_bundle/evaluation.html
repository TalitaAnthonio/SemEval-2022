<H3>Evaluation Criteria</H3>

<p>
	The participants can choose whether they want to work on <b> multiclass classification </b> and/or <b> regression </b>. Submitted systems 
	will be evaluated using the accuracy score (multi-class classificatiion) or Spearman's ranked correlation. 
</p>

<p> 
	TODO: visualize directory structure in a better way. 
	<br> 
	Each participant should submit a file of the format "answers.tsv.zip" with one of the following directories:  
	<ul>
		<li>Classification</li>
		<li>Ranking</li>
	  </ul>  
	
	The submitted file should be called "answers.tsv" and should contain two columns. The first should contain 
	the "Id" of the instance and the second one should contain the classes ("Class") in case of classification and "Score" 
	in case of Ranking.
