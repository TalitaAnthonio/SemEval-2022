<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<h4>Subtasks</h4>
<div>
	<p>The participants can choose whether they want to work on the <b>multiclass classification</b> and/or <b>ranking</b> subtask.<p>
</div>

<h5>Subtask A: Multi-Class Classification</h5>
<div>
	<p>For the classification subtask, the evaluation metric is the accuracy score.</p>
	<p>To convert each real-valued gold score provided by the annotators to a class label, we apply the following rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>score <= 2.5: implausible</li>
            <li>2.5 < score < 4: not-sure</li>
            <li>score >= 4: plausible</li>
        </ul>
	<p>When training your model for subtask A, you can also use these rules to convert the score for the training instances into class labels.</p>
</div>

<h5>Subtask B: Ranking</h5>
<div>
	<p>
		For the ranking subtask, the submissions will be scored based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
		which compares the predicted plausibility ranking over all test instances with the gold ranking.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the submission for the ranking subtask should contain the <b>predicted plausibility score</b> for each clarification (e. g. 4.5, 2.7 or 1.1)
		and not the ordinal rank in the the ranking itself (e. g. rank 1, 2, 3 ...).
		The evaluation script will automatically establish the resulting ranking based on the submitted plausibility scores.
	</p>
</div>

<h4>Submission Format</h4>
<p>
	Each participant should submit a zip-file called "answers.tsv.zip". It should contain two directories: 
	<!-- TODO: visualize directory structure in a better way. -->
	<ul>
		<li>classification</li>
		<li>ranking</li>
	  </ul>

	The directory "classification" should contain a tsv-file called "classification_answers.tsv" and the directory "ranking" should contain 
	a tsv-file called "ranking_answers.tsv". If you decide to only participate in one task, just leave the directory that indicates the task 
	that you are not participating in empty. Each tsv-file should contain two columns from left to right: (1) a column with the corresponding ids of each 
	data instance (2) the predictions of your system.
