<h3>Data</h3>
<h4>Data Source</h4>
<div>
    <p>
    The basis of our task is wikiHowToImprove (Anthonio et al., 2020), a collection of revisions of instructional texts from the how-to website <a href="http://www.wikihow.com">wikiHow</a>.
    This website consists of collaboratively edited how-to guides for everyday scenarios.
    Each article has a revision history that records the changes applied by different collaborators.

<h4>Clarification Phenomena</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        For this task, we extract revisions that we believe are likely to represent specific instances of clarifications for various semantic and pragmatic phenomena:
        <ul>
            <li>
                insertion of implicit references:
                <ul>
                    <li>In the original version of a sentence, there was an implicit reference to a previously mentioned entity. The revision makes this reference explicit.</li>
                    <li>Example: "Visit the salon's website. Call and ask questions." -> "Call the <b>salon</b> and ask questions."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                resolution of fused head noun phrases:
                <ul>
                    <li>In the original version, there is a noun phrase where the head noun is missing. The revision adds that noun.</li>
                    <li>Example: "The container must be exactly the same as the container you used to collect the water." -> "The container must be exactly the same <b>diameter</b> as the container you used to collect the water."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                completion of noun compounds:
                <ul>
                    <li>The revision adds a compound modifier to a noun to make its meaning more specific.</li>
                    <li>Example: "Send a card." -> "Send a <b>reminder</b> card."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                resolution of metonymic relations:
                <ul>
                    <li>In the original version, a noun is used in a metonymy. The revision makes the particular component or aspect of a noun explicit that is meant.</li>
                    <li>Example: "Screw each stringer to the deck frame with a drill." -> "Screw each stringer to <b>the top of</b> the deck frame with a drill."</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<h4>Annotation Process</h4>
<div>
    <p>
        To assess the plausibility of different clarification options, we automatically generate alternatives to the insertion an wikiHow contributor made.
        We treat each original sentence as a cloze test, inserting a blank at the position where the wikiHow contributor edited the text (e. g. "Send a _ card."). Then, we use a language model to fill this blank.
        We ask annotators to rate for each clarification option whether it "makes sense in the given how-to guide" (on a scale from 1 to 5).
        Afterwards, we average over the different ratings for one clarification to get the final gold score.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the classification subtask, we convert each real-valued gold score to a class label as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>score <= 2.5: implausible</li>
            <li>2.5 < score < 4: not-sure</li>
            <li>score >= 4: plausible</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</div>

<h4>Data Format</h4>
<div>
    <p>We provide the train and development set (available on <a href="https://clarificationtask.github.io/"> our task website</a>) for participants. </p>
    <p>The provided files are TSV files. Each row represents a modified sentence with 5 different fillers (1 human insertion, 4 automatically generated insertions).</p>
    <p>The train and development files contain the following columns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Article title": title of the wikiHow article in which the sentence occurs</li>
        <li>"Section header": heading of the section which the sentence is part of</li>
        <li>"Previous context": a couple of sentences that occur before the sentence in question - omissions are marked by "(...)"</li>
        <li>"Sentence": the sentence with a placeholder "______" that marks where the fillers should be inserted</li>
        <li>"Follow-up context": a couple of sentences that occur after the sentence in question - omissions are marked by "(...)"</li>
        <li>"Filler1" to "Filler5": the five different fillers</li>
        <li>"Rating1" to "Rating5": the corresponding plausibility scores for the 5 fillers - "Rating1" belongs to "Filler1", "Rating2" to "Filler2" and so on</li>
    </ul>
