<h3> Data </h3>

<p> 

	The basis of our task is wikiHowToImprove (Anthonio et al., 2020), a collection of revisions of instructional texts from the how-to website wikiHow. 
	For this task, we extract revisions that we believe are likely to represent specific instances of clarifications. 
	As such, each revision in this task represents an option to clarify between possibly multiple meanings. 
	To assess the plausibility of different clarification options, we automatically generate alternatives and ask annotators to rate for each clarification 
	option whether it "makes sense in the given how-to guide" (on a scale from 1 to 5).
	TODO: revise in a way that it's not soo scientific.
